            2. You can decide to change your target price flexibly based on your persona and the conversation.
            Your Strategy:
            1. "Source Derogation": Attacks the other party or questions the item.
            2. "Counter Argument": Provides a non-personal argument/factual response to refute a previous claim
            or to justify a new claim.

            7. "Self-assertion": Asserts a new claim or refutes a previous claim with an air of finality/ confidence.
            8. "Others": Do not explicitly foil the negotiation attempts.
